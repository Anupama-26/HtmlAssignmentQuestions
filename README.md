#question .7 In this example, we have an HTML document that includes an <h1> heading and an <audio> element. The <audio> element is used to embed an audio file into the webpage and provides built-in controls for playing, pausing, and adjusting the volume.

The <audio> tag contains a <source> element that specifies the audio file's source URL (src) and the MIME type (type). In the example, the audio file "song.mp3" is referenced with the MIME type "audio/mpeg". The browser will try to play the audio using the first source it supports, falling back to the "Your browser does not support the audio element." message if the browser doesn't support the <audio> tag or the specified audio format.

By using this code, you will have a basic music player that can play the audio file specified in the <source> tag. The controls provided by the browser will allow users to play, pause, and adjust the volume of the audio.#
